# Bulk One Image Video Creator

This project automates the creation of videos by combining `.jpeg` images with `.mp3` audio files. It scans a main folder and its subfolders for these files, creating videos by pairing them based on their order in the list.

## About

Bulk One Image Video Creator is designed to simplify the process of video creation by automatically pairing images and audio files in a specified directory structure. The tool supports the addition of a delay to the audio and the specification of a frame rate for the resulting video.

This project was developed with the help of OpenAI's ChatGPT, who provided valuable assistance and support in building the script and setting up the project.
